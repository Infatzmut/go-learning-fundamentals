testing package 

Go has a built-in test runner and framework for standard language tooling 

The easiest way to run unit tests for your project is using a command like go test ./... from the command line 

Running this command will discover and any tests within your current directory or their subdirectories
Tests must be in separate files from your main package code and with the suffix _test.go
